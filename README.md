# Hey, I'm Rubens 👋

Backend engineer based in Brazil, with 2 years of professional experience and a habit of going way too deep into problems — not because I have to, but because I genuinely need to understand *why* things work the way they do.

I'm currently sharpening my Go skills, building microservices with clean architecture, and learning something new every day.

---

## 🔧 What I work with

```go
stack := map[string][]string{
    "main":  {"Go", "PostgreSQL", "gRPC", "Docker"},
    "also":  {"Python", "Node.js", "REST", "SQL"},
    "ideas": {"Hexagonal Architecture", "DDD", "Clean Code"},
}
```

## 🚀 What I'm building

- **[auth-service](https://github.com/rubensantoniorosa2704/auth-service)** — Production-grade authentication microservice in Go. gRPC, Argon2id, JWT, hexagonal architecture, timing attack protection.
- **[logging-service](https://github.com/rubensantoniorosa2704/log-service)** — Real-time log streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- Contributing to open source Go projects — reading other people's code is one of the best ways to grow.

## 🧠 How I work

I'm the kind of engineer who dives deep into a task before writing a single line of code. I want to understand the problem fully — the constraints, the tradeoffs, the *why* behind the decisions. That curiosity sometimes makes me slower, but it makes the solution better.

I care a lot about:
- Writing code that others can read and trust
- Making intentional architectural decisions
- Learning the fundamentals, not just the framework

## 🎮 Beyond the terminal

When I'm not coding, I'm probably reading a book, playing video games, listening to music, or just taking a walk to let ideas settle.

## 📬 Let's connect

I'm open to remote backend opportunities — especially teams that care about craft and engineering quality.
